// THIS FILE IS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT USED BY THE APPLICATION.
//
// To run this application, you must set the `VITE_API_KEY` environment variable.
// The `VITE_` prefix is required by the build tools (like Vite) to securely
// expose the variable to the client-side code running in the browser.
//
// How you set this variable depends on your development and deployment environment.
//
// --- Local Development ---
//
// Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following line:
// VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
//
// --- Deployment (Vercel) ---
//
// Go to your project settings in Vercel, navigate to "Environment Variables",
// and add a variable with the name `VITE_API_KEY` and your key as the value.
//
// IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit your API key or the `.env.local` file to your Git repository.
